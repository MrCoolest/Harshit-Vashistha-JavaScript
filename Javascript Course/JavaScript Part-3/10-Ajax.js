// BASIC THEORY

// AJAX : asynchronous javascript and XML

// Http request doing

// is a set of "web development technology"
// using many web applications on the " client-side "
// to create asynchronous web application

// With Ajax, web applications can send and retrive 
// data from a server asynchrouusly (in the background)
// without interfacing with the display and behaviour of the  existing page


// we don't use the in XML formate anyware
// we use JSON now


// we have 3 most common ways to create and send request to server
// 1) xmlHTTPRequest (old way of doing)
// 2) fetch API (new way of doing)
// 3) axios (this is third party library)
